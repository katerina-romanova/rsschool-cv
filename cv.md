### About me:
---
During my university studies I received an excellent mathematical base, but because of the outdated views of the teachers I completely lost interest in programming. I took a large number of courses. I studied Data Engineering, ABAP, IBM Cognos BI, I liked it, but my dislike of programming from university haunted me. Now I work as an HR Manager in an IT company. I took the RS School course because despite my "failures" in the past I have excellent logical thinking, I really like to solve complex problems and it is difficult for me to live without it.
